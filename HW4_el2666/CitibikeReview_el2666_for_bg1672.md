### A). Null and Alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly:

The ratio of female riders to male riders is tested against the time of the day, which has been specified as a morning time (7 - 10 am) and evening time (4 - 7 pm).

### B). Data supports the project:

The initial dataset has been pre-processed in order to include only the needed variables of female, male riders and time of the day of the trip. Time of the day has been subsetted into 7-10 am and 4-7 pm.

### C). Given the question asked (the ratio of female riders to male riders dependent on the time of the day),

it is a question of proportions and comparison between two groups. A chi square test could be applied in this case.
