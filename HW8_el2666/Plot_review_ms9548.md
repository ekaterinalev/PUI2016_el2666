The plot is easy to read. It has all relevant elements (title, legend, axis labels). 

The resolution and size of the figure is appropriate (the figure space could even be slightly smaller) and makes for a clear graph, without distraction. 

Author's hypotheses is that those with lower educational attainment results are more likely to support Trump, and the regression line shown on the graph confirms that. The data is depicted without ambiguity or distortion. A good use of data/ink ratio. 

For suggestions, it might be useful to color regression line with another color, different from black points (e.g. red), to highlight more the final finding of the graph. The regression line is the center point of the plot and could be highlighted more, so - visually - readers can immediately grasp the finding. 

Interesting content and analysis, great work, thank you.
