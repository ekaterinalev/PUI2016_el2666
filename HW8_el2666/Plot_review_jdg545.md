The plot has all relevant attributes (title, legend, axis labels). Axis values are well-rendered (e.g. clear depiction of age range).

The resolution and figure size are chosen appropriately, data is shown without distraction.
I like the fact that there is a different choise for colors (each analysis is represented with a different color: red, green and blue). 

The topic of the research is interesting. As a reader (it might be my subjective view), I'm a bit confused as there are three different analysis represented (two polynomials and trip duration minimum).
In this one plot I would focus probably on only showing polynomials? 

The red line fit shows a clear trend which allows for an easy interpretation. 

An interesting content and analysis, great plot, thank you.
