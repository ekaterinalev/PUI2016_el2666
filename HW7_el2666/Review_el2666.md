<br>1.I think there should be a label in the upper right,which would make the plot more clear
<br>by explaining the meaning of lines.
<br>2.Since it is NYC violation offenses data,the plot title should reflect that, such as
<br>"NYC Violation Offenses Over Time(2000-2015)".
<br>Generally this is a great plot with appropriate fonts size and consistent color,
<br>presenting the information in a clear way!
